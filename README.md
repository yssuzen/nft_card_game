NFT Card Game
Introducing the NFT Card Game, a blockchain-based project where players can engage in live battles, select their preferred battleground, and compete against other players in real-time. This game harnesses the potential of Web 3.0 to create an immersive and dynamic gaming experience.
This project is built on the Avalanche platform and uses the Solidity programming language to create smart contracts and decentralized applications. You will also need a wallet to pair with the blockchain and connect your React.js application to the blockchain.

How to Play
Once the application is running, you can create a character and join battles with other players. You can choose your battleground and battle in real-time. Your battle results will be recorded on the blockchain using smart contracts.
